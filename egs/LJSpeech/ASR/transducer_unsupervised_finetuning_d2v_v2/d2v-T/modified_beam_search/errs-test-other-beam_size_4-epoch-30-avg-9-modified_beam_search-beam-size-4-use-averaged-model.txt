3331-159605-0029-2565:	SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST (BRILLIANT->BUOYANT) REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL (I M->I'M) GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
3331-159605-0030-2566:	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE (COQUETTE->COQUET) IN HER AND (I VE->I'VE) NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE (LIE CLEVERLY->LIKE LEVELLY)
3331-159605-0031-2567:	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE

3331-159609-0000-2583:	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO (WIDEN->BITE IN) HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001-2584:	FORTUNATELY (EVERY ONE->EVERYONE) WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT (BOTTLED->BUDDLED) UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS

3528-168669-0130-2834:	I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3538-142836-0000-1342:	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0001-1343:	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE (QUANTITIES THE->QUALITIES THIS) SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0002-1344:	FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0003-1345:	BUT (TO->HE) DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0004-1346:	IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE (SYRUP->SURF) AND APPLY (IT->*) TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE (SYRUP->SERF) WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0005-1347:	LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3538-142836-0006-1348:	IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0007-1349:	BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE (HAS->IS) NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0008-1350:	FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-142836-0009-1351:	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0010-1352:	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0011-1353:	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP (WILL->WOULD) BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0012-1354:	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY (ARE TURNED->RETURNED)
3538-142836-0013-1355:	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND (LEMON CHIPS->WOMENSHIPS) ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0014-1356:	MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT (PASTES->PIGS) ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0015-1357:	(MARMALADES->MARMALES) AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF (A->*) HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE (RINDS->RHINES) WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0016-1358:	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT (IS->AS) NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0017-1359:	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A (TRIVET->TRIBBET) UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0018-1360:	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0019-1361:	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS (ROOTS->*) AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN (PHARMACY->FARMACY) AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD (CONFICERE->CONFIRSSE) TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY (CUISINE->QUIZINE)
3538-142836-0020-1362:	THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER (THEY->THAT) CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021-1363:	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE (REIGNS->REIGN) OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
3538-142836-0022-1364:	THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL (AND->IN) CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-142836-0023-1365:	ICES
3538-142836-0024-1366:	AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY (TO BE->DULY) DISPENSED WITH
3538-142836-0025-1367:	THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-142836-0026-1368:	THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING (*->OF) THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0000-1300:	THERE WAS ONCE (ON->UPON) A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-163619-0001-1301:	FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-163619-0002-1302:	BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0003-1303:	KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
3538-163619-0004-1304:	(*->AND) WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-163619-0005-1305:	(THE YOUTH->LEAVE) PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-163619-0006-1306:	AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0007-1307:	WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0008-1308:	(*->AND) WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0009-1309:	ON THE (FIRST->THURS) THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE (TO LEND HER->TILL UNDER) A BRUSH
3538-163619-0010-1310:	SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0011-1311:	OUT ON (THEE->ME) UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163619-0012-1312:	I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163619-0013-1313:	THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0014-1314:	NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0000-1369:	WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN (FOALS->FOLDS) ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0001-1370:	THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO (WATCH->WASH) THE (FOALS->FOLDS) AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0002-1371:	HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0003-1372:	YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0004-1373:	HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0005-1374:	THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0006-1375:	WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE (FOALS->FOLDS) FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A (CLEFT->CLEF) IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A (DISTAFF->DISTIFF) AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163622-0007-1376:	COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0008-1377:	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE (FOALS RUN WHERE->FOLDS WHEREVER) THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0009-1378:	SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163622-0010-1379:	ON THE THIRD DAY (CINDERLAD->SYDA LAD) WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0011-1380:	THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND (CINDERLAD->CINDER LAD) SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0012-1381:	I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID (CINDERLAD->CINDER LAD)
3538-163622-0013-1382:	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID (CINDERLAD->TENDERLAND)
3538-163622-0014-1383:	AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0015-1384:	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE (FOAL->FOE) AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0016-1385:	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID (CINDERLAD->TINDER LAD)
3538-163622-0017-1386:	IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0018-1387:	(CINDERLAD->SINDER LAD) TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A (DRAUGHT->DROP) FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019-1388:	FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY (TROLL->TOLL) WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163622-0020-1389:	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE (FOAL->FOLK) SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0021-1390:	AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0022-1391:	NOW THEN SAID THE (FOAL->FOOL) DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023-1392:	THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0024-1393:	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED (CINDERLAD->SINDER LAD)
3538-163624-0000-1315:	ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163624-0001-1316:	THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163624-0002-1317:	BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0003-1318:	SO (HE->YOU) ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0004-1319:	THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0005-1320:	HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE (TUTOR->TUDOR) AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0006-1321:	THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0007-1322:	ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0008-1323:	SO (REGIN->REGAN) MADE A SWORD AND (SIGURD->SIGH) TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE

3764-168671-0052-1672:	(*->A) FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0053-1673:	THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0054-1674:	ONE MUST EAT

3997-180294-0001-586:	YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0002-587:	WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0003-588:	THERE ARE BOLTS (ON->IN) THE DOOR WRETCH

3997-180294-0009-594:	THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE (MYSTERIOUS->MYSTERY) VEIL
3997-180294-0010-595:	WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES (HAVE->HALF) BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0011-596:	THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0012-597:	WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER

3997-180294-0016-601:	BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0017-602:	BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY (LIAISON->LAIRSON)
3997-180294-0018-603:	WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY

3997-180294-0027-612:	DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0028-613:	WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD

3997-180294-0030-615:	WHERE AT HOME
3997-180294-0031-616:	YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0032-617:	BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180294-0033-618:	(NONETHELESS->NONE THE LESS) I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE (GET->GOT) INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0000-640:	I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0001-641:	YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0002-642:	WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE

3997-180297-0004-644:	MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0005-645:	YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU (WOULD WANT->WERE ONE) TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180297-0006-646:	BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0007-647:	IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180297-0008-648:	IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0009-649:	(HONESTLY->ON THE SLEE) DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0010-650:	I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0011-651:	WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012-652:	I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0013-653:	WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE (FEET->FEAT) I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE (HAS->HAD) INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0014-654:	TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC (DESIRES->DESIRE) AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0015-655:	WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0016-656:	WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0017-657:	WE STAND FIRST (IN->AND) THEIR SELF ESTEEM (*->THE) LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018-658:	NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0019-659:	IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE
3997-180297-0020-660:	SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0021-661:	I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFFERED ME (BUT->OR) WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE

4350-10919-0010-2619:	BEG PARDON IS THE (YAUSKY->YOSEK) BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
4350-10919-0011-2620:	HE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0012-2621:	OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-10919-0013-2622:	AND HOW ABOUT (A TOUR ABROAD->IT TO HER BROUGHT) ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
4350-10919-0014-2623:	WHAT IS WANTED IS (*->THE) MEANS OF IMPROVING (NUTRITION->ATTRITION) AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0015-2624:	THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0016-2625:	BUT IN (FAVOR->FAVOUR) OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
4350-10919-0017-2626:	AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0018-2627:	AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE (GERMAN->DREAMING) QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0019-2628:	OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0020-2629:	THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0021-2630:	OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0022-2631:	AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0023-2632:	WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0024-2633:	SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0025-2634:	EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026-2635:	THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0027-2636:	THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE (OFFENSE->OFFENCE)
4350-10919-0028-2637:	NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0029-2638:	AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH (WERE->WAS) CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-10919-0030-2639:	AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0031-2640:	FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-10919-0032-2641:	IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-10919-0033-2642:	THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0000-2643:	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-9170-0001-2644:	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0002-2645:	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN (INTERESTS->INTEREST) FOR THE (INTERESTS->INTEREST) OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003-2646:	THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0004-2647:	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-9170-0005-2648:	THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0006-2649:	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON (IN->AND) SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-9170-0007-2650:	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT (CONSTITUTE->CONSTITUTES) THE ARMY
4350-9170-0008-2651:	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0009-2652:	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-9170-0010-2653:	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0011-2654:	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0012-2655:	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0013-2656:	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW (STANDARD->STANDARDS) OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF (*->THE) GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0014-2657:	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN (*->THE) INDIVIDUALS (SEEMS->SEEMED) STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0015-2658:	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
4350-9170-0016-2659:	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0017-2660:	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0018-2661:	INTERNAL (DISSENSIONS->DESCENSIONS) DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE (DISSENTIENT->DISSENTIAN) INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0019-2662:	GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0020-2663:	AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0021-2664:	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0022-2665:	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0023-2666:	(FOOTNOTE->FOOTNOTES) THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF (THE->A) SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0024-2667:	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0025-2668:	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE (CENTER->CENTRE) ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0026-2669:	THE MEANING OF (CAPRIVI'S->KUPRIVI') SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0027-2670:	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0028-2671:	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND (*->ARE) ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS (ENSLAVED->ENSLAVE) SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0029-2672:	AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030-2673:	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT (ONE->A) HUNDRED (*->AND) FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0031-2674:	EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032-2675:	THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0033-2676:	THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0034-2677:	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES (PRACTICED->PRACTISED) UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0035-2678:	THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0036-2679:	IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN (*->THE) MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE (TRANSITORINESS->TRANSITORENESS) OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0037-2680:	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0038-2681:	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY (EXPOSE->EXPOSED) THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0039-2682:	THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040-2683:	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF (LIFE->LIFE'S) SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0041-2684:	BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0042-2685:	GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0043-2686:	THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0044-2687:	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4350-9170-0045-2688:	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0046-2689:	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0047-2690:	WE (KNOW->*) NOW (*->KNOW) THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0048-2691:	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL (DISPOSED->DISCLOSED) PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER (NOW->KNOWN)
4350-9170-0049-2692:	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
4350-9170-0050-2693:	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING (ANY THING->ANYTHING)
4350-9170-0051-2694:	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0052-2695:	THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0053-2696:	WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0054-2697:	THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0055-2698:	AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0056-2699:	THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0057-2700:	EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE (STATE->STATES) NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH (*->THE) STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0058-2701:	TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4350-9170-0059-2702:	SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY (CLASSES->CLASS) AN OPPRESSOR
4350-9170-0060-2703:	FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4852-28311-0000-0:	SAY YOU KNOW (SUMTHIN->SOMETHIN)
4852-28311-0001-1:	CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED (FLASHLIGHT->FLASH LIKE) TO A (CAR->CURRA) JACK (AND->AN) SPARK PLUG
4852-28311-0002-2:	(KNOW WHO->NO) NEEDS A JOB (BAD->BAN) THAT'S (JAKEY->JAKIE) HARRIS
4852-28311-0003-3:	O K HE SAID
4852-28311-0004-4:	ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK (HIM->EM) YOURSELF
4852-28311-0005-5:	MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
4852-28311-0006-6:	WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0007-7:	CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0008-8:	THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
4852-28311-0009-9:	HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR (JAKEY->JAKIE) WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK (EDGING->EDGED) INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0010-10:	MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT (ONCE TO->WHAT DID) ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY (PARTLY->PARTIALLY) ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0011-11:	(BETCHA->BUT YOU) AREN'T (GOIN->GOING) AFTER ALL (CHRIS->JUST) TURNED ON HIM
4852-28311-0012-12:	MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
4852-28311-0013-13:	(AW SHUCKS->OUR SHARKS)
4852-28311-0014-14:	CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING (THE->A) BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28311-0015-15:	AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE (L->ALE) SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE (AND->IN) PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0016-16:	(THE->NO) LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK (HAD->GOT) A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED (ONTO->ON A) WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND (WISCONSIN->MISCONSIN) AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX (SHRUBS->SHRUGS) AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0017-17:	A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND (GRAY->GLAY) CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0018-18:	THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH (HIS->THE) JOB
4852-28311-0019-19:	ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING (IN->AND) HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0020-20:	AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0021-21:	THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0022-22:	ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE (CENTER->CENTRE OF) THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28311-0023-23:	BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0024-24:	(HE HAD->HE'D) NEVER SEEN (ANYONE->ANY ONE) GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0025-25:	HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0026-26:	A SUDDEN (CAR HORN WOKE HIM->CARNES WALKING) FROM HIS DREAM
4852-28312-0000-27:	OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND (PORED->POURED) OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28312-0001-28:	SO NOW ALONE UNTIL (SOMEONE->SOME ONE) SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL (HE->THEY) LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28312-0002-29:	WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW (AND->*) THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS (SOMBER->SOMBRE)
4852-28312-0003-30:	HEAVY HAND (HEWN->YOU AND) BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0004-31:	MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0005-32:	THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE (AND JOINING->ENJOINING) WITH THOSE OVER THE (CHEEKBONES->CHEEK BONES) WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0006-33:	LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE (FUZZ->FUSS) ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD (CHRIS'S->CHRISSA'S) GAZE (WERE->WITH) THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0007-34:	(CHRIS BLINKED AND->CRISP LINCOLN) LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0008-35:	CHRIS SWALLOWED (AND->YET) HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0009-36:	YES SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0010-37:	I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE (JOB->JOG)
4852-28312-0011-38:	HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
4852-28312-0012-39:	(JAKEY HARRIS HIS->JACKIE HARRIS'S) NAME (IS AND->ISN'T) HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0013-40:	I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0014-41:	WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD (HUMOR->HUMOUR) IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0015-42:	HE GUESSED THERE (*->IT) MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0016-43:	WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH (JAKEY'S->JAKES) GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0017-44:	BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY (HAD HE->HAVE YOU) NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE (CORNER->CORRIDOR) OF (WATER->WALDUR) STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD (THE TRAFFIC->THEFIC) SIGNALS
4852-28312-0018-45:	THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0019-46:	THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28312-0020-47:	THE WIDE (BOW WINDOW->BOUGH WIND THAT) WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0021-48:	ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE (FREEWAY->FREE WAY)
4852-28312-0022-49:	IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28312-0023-50:	THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0024-51:	FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS (CHRIS->CHRISP) WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT (*->OF) THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0025-52:	NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO (LAMPLIT->LAMPHLET) STREETS
4852-28312-0026-53:	WHERE THE PEOPLE'S (DRUGSTORE->DRUG STORE) HAD STOOD BUT (A->*) HALF (*->AN) HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS (EVIDENTLY->EVIDENTIALLY) AN INN
4852-28312-0027-54:	A COURTYARD WAS (SPARSELY->FIRSTLY) LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
4852-28312-0028-55:	THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0029-56:	(A->THE) COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED (TO->*) A HALT BESIDE THE (FLAGGED->FLAND) COURTYARD
4852-28312-0030-57:	THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0031-58:	MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28319-0000-85:	THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28319-0001-86:	HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS (HORDE->HOARD) OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28319-0002-87:	CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0003-88:	ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE (*->HAD) RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A (BOWL->BALL) WITH A (GOLDFISH->GOLD FISH) IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0004-89:	WHAT (SHALL I->SHOULD ALLAH) DO FIRST
4852-28319-0005-90:	HOW (YOU HAVE IMPROVED->YOU'VE BEEN PROVED) MY BOY (HE->KIT) EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY (AND->*) THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0006-91:	SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND (CAN'T CHANGE->CATCH JANE'S) BACK
4852-28319-0007-92:	MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE

6128-63240-0007-1947:	THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA

6128-63241-0001-1969:	THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT (CLIME->CLIMB) AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND (CURSORILY->CURSERY) DEPLORED IN MISSUS (LUNA'S->LUNNY'S) SISTER
6128-63241-0002-1970:	(RANSOM->RANSON) WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL

6128-63241-0009-1977:	(OLIVE->OLIVER) HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63241-0010-1978:	SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0011-1979:	SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON

6128-63244-0006-1988:	SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS (FARRINDER->FALINDER) SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN (A->HER) REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
