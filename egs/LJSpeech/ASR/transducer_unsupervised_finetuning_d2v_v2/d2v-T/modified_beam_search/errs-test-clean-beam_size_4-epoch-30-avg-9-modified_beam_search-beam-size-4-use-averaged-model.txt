1188-133604-0008-131:	FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE (RED->READ) AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS IN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
1188-133604-0009-132:	NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS IF THEY ARE GRADATED JUSTLY
1188-133604-0010-133:	BUT IN THIS (VIGNETTE->VINET) COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
1188-133604-0011-134:	THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GRAY PAPER

1188-133604-0015-138:	THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
1188-133604-0016-139:	THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0017-140:	THAT A STYLE (IS->AS) RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
1188-133604-0018-141:	IN ALL (EARLY->EARTHLY) GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART

1188-133604-0021-144:	IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE (PURIST->PUREST) PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0022-145:	YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
1188-133604-0023-146:	THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS (PAROQUET->PEROQUET) WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
1188-133604-0024-147:	NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER

1188-133604-0034-157:	EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD (AND->IN) OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
1188-133604-0035-158:	THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM
1188-133604-0036-159:	IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL
1188-133604-0037-160:	EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WHERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT IS LOVELY AND SET DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF (HOLBEIN->HOLBINE) OR (DUERER->DEW)
1188-133604-0038-161:	BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL

121-127105-0007-27:	TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
121-127105-0008-28:	HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S
121-127105-0009-29:	SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
121-127105-0010-30:	SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
121-127105-0011-31:	SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
121-127105-0012-32:	IT WASN'T SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
121-127105-0013-33:	YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
121-127105-0014-34:	YOU ARE ACUTE
121-127105-0015-35:	HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
121-127105-0016-36:	PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
121-127105-0017-37:	IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY
121-127105-0018-38:	CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED
121-127105-0019-39:	MISSUS (GRIFFIN->GRYFFIN) HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
121-127105-0020-40:	WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN
121-127105-0021-41:	WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS
121-127105-0022-42:	WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
121-127105-0023-43:	LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
121-127105-0024-44:	POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH
121-127105-0025-45:	THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED US UP
121-127105-0026-46:	THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN
121-127105-0027-47:	HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
121-127105-0028-48:	THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
121-127105-0029-49:	THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY
121-127105-0030-50:	I DON'T ANTICIPATE
121-127105-0031-51:	SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES (AND->IN) LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS
121-127105-0032-52:	YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION
121-127105-0033-53:	IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
121-127105-0034-54:	IT SOUNDED DULL (IT->THAT) SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN CONDITION WHICH WAS
121-127105-0035-55:	SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED
121-127105-0036-56:	BUT WAS THAT ALL HER REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED
1221-135766-0000-225:	HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THREW ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD
1221-135766-0001-226:	GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME (DISHONOURED->DISHONORED) BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOR EVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
1221-135766-0002-227:	YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION
1221-135766-0003-228:	THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY (CO EXIST->COEXIST) WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME IT BEST
1221-135766-0004-229:	THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
1221-135766-0005-230:	HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH
1221-135766-0006-231:	THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
1221-135766-0007-232:	HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
1221-135766-0008-233:	MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE
1221-135766-0009-234:	AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
1221-135766-0010-235:	IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
1221-135766-0011-236:	BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH (A->*) CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE
1221-135766-0012-237:	BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
1221-135766-0013-238:	PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD
1221-135766-0014-239:	PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
1221-135766-0015-240:	IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN
1221-135767-0000-241:	HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONOURABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY
1221-135767-0001-242:	ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
1221-135767-0002-243:	AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF HESTER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE
1221-135767-0003-244:	THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE (FRAMEWORK->FRAME WORK) ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE
1221-135767-0004-245:	WE HAVE SPOKEN OF (PEARL'S->PEARLS) RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
1221-135767-0005-246:	IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE
1221-135767-0006-247:	THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE
1221-135767-0007-248:	BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
1221-135767-0008-249:	COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM
1221-135767-0009-250:	BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE KNOT OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT
1221-135767-0010-251:	SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
1221-135767-0011-252:	IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES
1221-135767-0012-253:	THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICE WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED
1221-135767-0013-254:	LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND (SERVANT->SERVANTS) A FREE BORN (ENGLISHMAN->ENGLISH MAN) BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE
1221-135767-0014-255:	YEA HIS HONOURABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH
1221-135767-0015-256:	(YE->YEA) MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
1221-135767-0016-257:	WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND
1221-135767-0017-258:	ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE
1221-135767-0018-259:	LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING (FRONTISPIECE->FRONTICE PIECE) OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE
1221-135767-0019-260:	MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK
1221-135767-0020-261:	IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT
1221-135767-0021-262:	PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AND IMMATURE ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY
1221-135767-0022-263:	BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING
1221-135767-0023-264:	THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A (BULL->BOWL)
1221-135767-0024-265:	PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED
1284-1180-0000-1714:	HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANTS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD
1284-1180-0001-1715:	HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN (AND->AT) A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE BRIM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED
1284-1180-0002-1716:	INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID
1284-1180-0003-1717:	FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED
1284-1180-0004-1718:	WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNC SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH
1284-1180-0005-1719:	NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF (ANYONE->ANY ONE) CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE
1284-1180-0006-1720:	AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED
1284-1180-0007-1721:	HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOR
1284-1180-0008-1722:	ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNC AND OJO SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET
1284-1180-0009-1723:	THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPT
1284-1180-0010-1724:	UNC KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE
1284-1180-0011-1725:	I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME
1284-1180-0012-1726:	WE HAVE COME FROM A FAR LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE
1284-1180-0013-1727:	AND YOU MUST BE OJO THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED
1284-1180-0014-1728:	OJO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE
1284-1180-0015-1729:	WE ARE (TRAVELING->TRAVELLING) REPLIED OJO AND WE (STOPPED->STOP) AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES
1284-1180-0016-1730:	THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL
1284-1180-0017-1731:	AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0018-1732:	IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOLOTTE WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
1284-1180-0019-1733:	YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARGOLOTTE WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD (MOMBI->MAMBE) THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
1284-1180-0020-1734:	THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
1284-1180-0021-1735:	I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
1284-1180-0022-1736:	I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ
1284-1180-0023-1737:	YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC (NUNKIE->NUNKY) THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
1284-1180-0024-1738:	THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE OJO THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE
1284-1180-0025-1739:	I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARGOLOTTE LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN
1284-1180-0026-1740:	BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES
1284-1180-0027-1741:	YET THAT TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
1284-1180-0028-1742:	A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND (COLORS->COLLARS) OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER
1284-1180-0029-1743:	SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP
1284-1180-0030-1744:	WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIFE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD NOR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF (COLORS->COLOURS) WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKINS ARE
1284-1180-0031-1745:	AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA LIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOR
1284-1180-0032-1746:	I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS
1284-1181-0000-1684:	OJO EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER
1284-1181-0001-1685:	MARGOLOTTE HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAY MATERIAL THROUGHOUT
1284-1181-0002-1686:	THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER
1284-1181-0003-1687:	THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK IN SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS
1284-1181-0004-1688:	GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE
1284-1181-0005-1689:	NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
1284-1181-0006-1690:	WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARGOLOTTE BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
1284-1181-0007-1691:	SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES
1284-1181-0008-1692:	I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT
1284-1181-0009-1693:	SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELPED HIM LIFT THE FOUR KETTLES FROM THE FIRE
1284-1181-0010-1694:	THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER
1284-1181-0011-1695:	VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT (ALL TOGETHER->ALTOGETHER) IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON
1284-1181-0012-1696:	NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD
1284-1181-0013-1697:	OJO BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE AND SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS
1284-1181-0014-1698:	HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES
1284-1181-0015-1699:	MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TOO LITTLE
1284-1181-0016-1700:	I AM NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE
1284-1181-0017-1701:	THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG AND KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT HE IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS
1284-1181-0018-1702:	IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN
1284-1181-0019-1703:	I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN
1284-1181-0020-1704:	DEAR ME WHAT A (CHATTERBOX->CHATTER BOX) YOU'RE GETTING TO BE UNC REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT
1284-1181-0021-1705:	ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS
1284-134647-0000-1706:	THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGED THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST
1284-134647-0001-1707:	THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION
1284-134647-0002-1708:	BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
1284-134647-0003-1709:	(CONSTANTINE->KONSTANTINE) EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION
1284-134647-0004-1710:	SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY
1284-134647-0005-1711:	THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILT AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED (INVIOLATE->IN VIOLET) THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE
1284-134647-0006-1712:	BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS
1284-134647-0007-1713:	PROSCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATISTS STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN (NUMIDIA->AMIDIA) THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGED THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE
1320-122612-0000-1793:	SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGE IS EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES
1320-122612-0001-1794:	THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE (TRAVELERS->TRAVELLERS) RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
1320-122612-0002-1795:	AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL
1320-122612-0003-1796:	HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS
1320-122612-0004-1797:	DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
1320-122612-0005-1798:	YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
1320-122612-0006-1799:	LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES
1320-122612-0007-1800:	CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK
1320-122612-0008-1801:	THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED
1320-122612-0009-1802:	IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A (BIDDING->BITING)
1320-122612-0010-1803:	SEE SAID UNCAS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST
1320-122612-0011-1804:	IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE (CLEW->CLUE) THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY
1320-122612-0012-1805:	EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN BROWSED BY THE HORSES
1320-122612-0013-1806:	A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION
1320-122612-0014-1807:	THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY
1320-122612-0015-1808:	THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A (MOCCASIN->MOCCASINE) IN THE MOIST (ALLUVION->ALLUVIAN)
1320-122612-0016-1809:	RUN BACK UNCAS AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT
1320-122617-0000-1810:	NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR
1320-122617-0001-1811:	IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE AND PRACTISED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN
1320-122617-0002-1812:	IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF (BALAAM'S->BAILEM'S) ASS TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT (SKEPTICAL->SCEPTICAL) ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS
1320-122617-0003-1813:	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND
1320-122617-0004-1814:	THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION
1320-122617-0005-1815:	THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
1320-122617-0006-1816:	CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
1320-122617-0007-1817:	COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE (UNCASING->UNCACING) HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS
1320-122617-0008-1818:	THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED
1320-122617-0009-1819:	I GREATLY MOURN THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HYMN CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM
1320-122617-0010-1820:	THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASE THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES
1320-122617-0011-1821:	THE LODGE IN WHICH UNCAS WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY (CENTER->CENTRE) OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION
1320-122617-0012-1822:	FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF UNCAS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE
1320-122617-0013-1823:	DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE IN WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS (IN->AND) AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED
1320-122617-0014-1824:	THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED (CONJURER->CONJUROR) TO ENTER
1320-122617-0015-1825:	BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEAT IT HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED
1320-122617-0016-1826:	THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID IMPROVING THE HINT HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF
1320-122617-0017-1827:	THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE
1320-122617-0018-1828:	IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE (PURPOSED->PURPOSE) OF COOKERY
1320-122617-0019-1829:	UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL (WITHES->WITHS)
1320-122617-0020-1830:	THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY
1320-122617-0021-1831:	WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOES AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND (THIS->THE) SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING
1320-122617-0022-1832:	THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE DEER
1320-122617-0023-1833:	UNCAS WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE
1320-122617-0024-1834:	BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION
1320-122617-0025-1835:	SO UNCAS YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED
1320-122617-0026-1836:	WELL WHAT CAN'T BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE (IN->AND) WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION
1320-122617-0027-1837:	AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
1320-122617-0028-1838:	MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS
1320-122617-0029-1839:	IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON (COMPOSSER->COMPOSSOR) WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED
1320-122617-0030-1840:	SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY HERE
1320-122617-0031-1841:	BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY HAS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE
1320-122617-0032-1842:	KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
1320-122617-0033-1843:	IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT UNCAS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT AS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS
1320-122617-0034-1844:	HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AND HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE
1320-122617-0035-1845:	THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN
1320-122617-0036-1846:	GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR (SCENT->SIN) IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS (AND->IN) THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION
1320-122617-0037-1847:	THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID
1320-122617-0038-1848:	WILL THE HURONS HEAR HIS GROANS
1320-122617-0039-1849:	THE (MOHICAN->MOHICANS) STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT
1320-122617-0040-1850:	HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
1320-122617-0041-1851:	UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS
1580-141083-0000-1630:	I WILL (ENDEAVOUR->ENDEAVOR) IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED
1580-141083-0001-1631:	I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
1580-141083-0002-1632:	MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
1580-141083-0003-1633:	WITHOUT HIS (SCRAPBOOKS->SCRAP BOOKS) HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
1580-141083-0004-1634:	I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
1580-141083-0005-1635:	I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
1580-141083-0006-1636:	THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT (BANNISTER->BANISTER) A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
1580-141083-0007-1637:	THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS
1580-141083-0008-1638:	THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
1580-141083-0009-1639:	THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT (SOMEONE->SOME ONE) PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
1580-141083-0010-1640:	I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
1580-141083-0011-1641:	A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
1580-141083-0012-1642:	NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
1580-141083-0013-1643:	ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
1580-141083-0014-1644:	TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
1580-141083-0015-1645:	DID (ANYONE->ANY ONE) KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
1580-141083-0016-1646:	I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
1580-141083-0017-1647:	SO IT SEEMS TO ME
1580-141083-0018-1648:	NOW MISTER (SOAMES->SOLMES) AT YOUR DISPOSAL
1580-141083-0019-1649:	ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
1580-141083-0020-1650:	THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
1580-141083-0021-1651:	THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE (PANE->PAIN) SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
1580-141083-0022-1652:	(I AM->I'M) AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
1580-141083-0023-1653:	ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
1580-141083-0024-1654:	YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
1580-141083-0025-1655:	THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
1580-141083-0026-1656:	AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID (SOAMES->SOLMES) FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
1580-141083-0027-1657:	HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
1580-141083-0028-1658:	THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
1580-141083-0029-1659:	HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
1580-141083-0030-1660:	MISTER (SOAMES->PSALMS) WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
1580-141083-0031-1661:	HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
1580-141083-0032-1662:	WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS
1580-141083-0033-1663:	I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING
1580-141083-0034-1664:	AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND (*->AN) ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
1580-141083-0035-1665:	HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR (HALLOA WHAT'S->HELLOA WHAT IS) THIS
1580-141083-0036-1666:	HOLMES (HELD IT->HUDDED) OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
1580-141083-0037-1667:	WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
1580-141083-0038-1668:	I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS (STAIR->STARE) AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
1580-141083-0039-1669:	AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES
1580-141083-0040-1670:	ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
1580-141083-0041-1671:	LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
1580-141083-0042-1672:	MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL
1580-141083-0043-1673:	THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO (MILES->MYLES) MC LAREN
1580-141083-0044-1674:	I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY
1580-141083-0045-1675:	HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
1580-141083-0046-1676:	BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
1580-141083-0047-1677:	DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
1580-141083-0048-1678:	HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR

1580-141084-0002-1581:	THIS SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM
1580-141084-0003-1582:	NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT (GILCHRIST'S->GILCRIST'S) DOOR
1580-141084-0004-1583:	OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
1580-141084-0005-1584:	THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES
1580-141084-0006-1585:	YOU DON'T SEEM TO (REALIZE->REALISE) THE POSITION

1580-141084-0009-1588:	IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
1580-141084-0010-1589:	I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOOD BYE
1580-141084-0011-1590:	WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS

1580-141084-0023-1602:	IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
1580-141084-0024-1603:	HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
1580-141084-0025-1604:	YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
1580-141084-0026-1605:	IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL

2094-142345-0008-70:	BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW (BILLED->BILL) DUCKS WHO ARE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY IN IT AS POSSIBLE
2094-142345-0009-71:	FOR THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBY THE (WHITTAW->WOODAW) OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST (TREDDLESTON->TREDDLESTONE) GOSSIP

2094-142345-0013-75:	HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EARSHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF
2094-142345-0014-76:	THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE (WHITTAWS->WIDOWS) AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY

2300-131720-0010-1201:	IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT
2300-131720-0011-1202:	BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS A REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR A FARM HOUSE THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL
2300-131720-0012-1203:	EDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND (SHODDY->SHATTI) AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST (TUBE->*) AND GALVANOMETER
2300-131720-0013-1204:	UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY (GOVERNED->GOVERN) AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
2300-131720-0014-1205:	MISTER EDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME
2300-131720-0015-1206:	HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH A FRICTION (BRAKE->BREAK) ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT
2300-131720-0016-1207:	THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO (LUBRICATE->LUBRICADE) AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER EDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES
2300-131720-0017-1208:	EDISON HAD INSTALLED (HIS->*) HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A (STRAIGHT->STRAIT) TWO WIRE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT OF THE TREE KIND
2300-131720-0018-1209:	HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT (DISTRICTS->DISTRICT) OF LARGE CITIES
2300-131720-0019-1210:	THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
2300-131720-0020-1211:	IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLANT ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A YIELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE (POWER->BOWER) WAS CONSIDERED SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION
2300-131720-0021-1212:	THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD POLE LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY EDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS
2300-131720-0022-1213:	MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE WIRE SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER EDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME
2300-131720-0023-1214:	I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE (THAN->THAT) I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE EDISON CONSTRUCTION DEPARTMENT AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP
2300-131720-0024-1215:	BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
2300-131720-0025-1216:	THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF (EDISONIA->EDESONIA) BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE
2300-131720-0026-1217:	THE (ARC->ARK) LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT TO REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT
2300-131720-0027-1218:	EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
2300-131720-0028-1219:	THERE WAS INFINITE SCEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
2300-131720-0029-1220:	HENCE THE EDISON (ELECTROLYTIC->ELECTROLETIC) METER IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES
2300-131720-0030-1221:	THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE EDISON (ELECTROLYTIC->ELECTROLETIC) METER IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE
2300-131720-0031-1222:	ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE
2300-131720-0032-1223:	THE STANDARD EDISON (METER->METRE) PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
2300-131720-0033-1224:	IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W (J JENKS->JINKS) READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER
2300-131720-0034-1225:	THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS
2300-131720-0035-1226:	IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF EDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE EDISON (METER->METRE) WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SELLING CURRENT BY METER
2300-131720-0036-1227:	THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
2300-131720-0037-1228:	HE WEIGHED AND (REWEIGHED->REWIGED) THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
2300-131720-0038-1229:	HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER
2300-131720-0039-1230:	THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
2300-131720-0040-1231:	WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART
2300-131720-0041-1232:	WE HAD (METERS->METRES) IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID
237-126133-0000-787:	HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME
237-126133-0001-788:	EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED TO FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS
237-126133-0002-789:	THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS
237-126133-0003-790:	SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
237-126133-0004-791:	IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE PHRONSIE FOR JUST ONE MOMENT
237-126133-0005-792:	OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID (VAN->FAN) SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED
237-126133-0006-793:	AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPENED SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED PHRONSIE
237-126133-0007-794:	BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL
237-126133-0008-795:	ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN
237-126133-0009-796:	NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
237-126133-0010-797:	OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME
237-126133-0011-798:	ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER IN INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT
237-126133-0012-799:	THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD
237-126133-0013-800:	I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU
237-126133-0014-801:	ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER'S SIDE
237-126133-0015-802:	YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY AND WINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAUGHING HE DID NOW TRULY PHRONSIE
237-126133-0016-803:	OH NO (JASPER->JAPSER) I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
237-126133-0017-804:	THERE JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAUGHED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER'S FACE
237-126133-0018-805:	DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER TWASN'T HER FAULT
237-126133-0019-806:	DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO
237-126133-0020-807:	HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO
237-126133-0021-808:	SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER
237-126133-0022-809:	I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED IT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY
237-126133-0023-810:	HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
237-126133-0024-811:	AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME
237-126133-0025-812:	AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY
237-134493-0000-768:	IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN (BERGSON->BURGSON) DIED
237-134493-0001-769:	HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKS THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS
237-134493-0002-770:	FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST (CHECKER->CHEQUER) BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT
237-134493-0003-771:	FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN (GAYLY->GAILY) PAINTED (FARMHOUSES->FARM HOUSES) THE GILDED WEATHER (VANES->VEINS) ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0004-772:	THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER
237-134493-0005-773:	HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GRAY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW
237-134493-0006-774:	THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO (TOWN AND->TOWNIN) BACK
237-134493-0007-775:	ALEXANDRA (LETS->THAT'S) YOU SLEEP LATE
237-134493-0008-776:	SHE GATHERED UP HER REINS
237-134493-0009-777:	PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARIE (EMIL->AYMIL) COAXED
237-134493-0010-778:	I NEVER SEE LOU'S SCYTHE OVER HERE
237-134493-0011-779:	HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HAD AN ATHLETE TO MOW MY ORCHARD
237-134493-0012-780:	I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO (PICK->PIG) CHERRIES
237-134493-0013-781:	INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT
237-134493-0014-782:	THEY THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING
237-134493-0015-783:	THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL
237-134493-0016-784:	ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE YOU REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS
237-134493-0017-785:	ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA (BERGSON->BURGSON)
237-134493-0018-786:	THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES
237-134500-0000-813:	FRANK READ ENGLISH SLOWLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW
237-134500-0001-814:	MARIE SIGHED
237-134500-0002-815:	A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
237-134500-0003-816:	THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN
237-134500-0004-817:	THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER
237-134500-0005-818:	OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE (MOWED->MOULD)
237-134500-0006-819:	JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
237-134500-0007-820:	WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF (THEM IN->THE MEN) HERE BEFORE
237-134500-0008-821:	I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO
237-134500-0009-822:	I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THEN
237-134500-0010-823:	IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT
237-134500-0011-824:	AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
237-134500-0012-825:	IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SCYTHE WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN
237-134500-0013-826:	MARIE PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING BRANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE CAUGHT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR
237-134500-0014-827:	AND (EMIL->AMIA) MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
237-134500-0015-828:	THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN (SHABATA->CHEBATA) AND HIS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS
237-134500-0016-829:	I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW LINDENS ARE
237-134500-0017-830:	IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY
237-134500-0018-831:	HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INSIPID FRUIT LONG IVORY COLORED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CORAL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH
237-134500-0019-832:	HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
237-134500-0020-833:	YES DON'T YOU
237-134500-0021-834:	OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF (STAID AND->STAY AT AN) SCHOOL TEACHERY
237-134500-0022-835:	WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM
237-134500-0023-836:	IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH (CARL->KARL)
237-134500-0024-837:	I LIKE TO TALK TO (CARL->KARL) ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE
237-134500-0025-838:	(OH EMIL->O AMIL)
237-134500-0026-839:	SURELY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE
237-134500-0027-840:	(MARIE'S->MARI'S) FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE
237-134500-0028-841:	I'M SURE (ALEXANDRA->ALEXANDER) HOPES YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED
237-134500-0029-842:	I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND AND LOOK ON
237-134500-0030-843:	I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT
237-134500-0031-844:	SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A (TABLE CLOTH->TABLECLOTH)
237-134500-0032-845:	I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN
237-134500-0033-846:	I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
237-134500-0034-847:	THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY
237-134500-0035-848:	AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME
237-134500-0036-849:	I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MARIE
237-134500-0037-850:	BUT (EMIL->AMIEL) IF I UNDERSTAND THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE
237-134500-0038-851:	AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND
237-134500-0039-852:	THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO
237-134500-0040-853:	I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAYED YOURSELF
237-134500-0041-854:	I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
237-134500-0042-855:	THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER
260-123286-0000-2092:	SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT

260-123286-0002-2094:	ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
260-123286-0003-2095:	YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS
260-123286-0004-2096:	ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
260-123286-0005-2097:	I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE
260-123286-0006-2098:	WE ARE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT
260-123286-0007-2099:	HE CALLED THIS SEA (A POND->UPON) AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
260-123286-0008-2100:	THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS
260-123286-0009-2101:	I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
260-123286-0010-2102:	SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH
260-123286-0011-2103:	NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS

260-123286-0013-2105:	THE SHADOW OF THE RAFT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES
260-123286-0014-2106:	TRULY (THIS->THE) SEA IS OF INFINITE WIDTH
260-123286-0015-2107:	IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT
260-123286-0016-2108:	THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP
260-123286-0017-2109:	I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE
260-123286-0018-2110:	I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH
260-123286-0019-2111:	I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE
260-123286-0020-2112:	TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH
260-123286-0021-2113:	DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT

260-123286-0023-2115:	THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCHED DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS
260-123286-0024-2116:	THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR
260-123286-0025-2117:	FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILES ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
260-123286-0026-2118:	TWO MONSTERS ONLY WERE CREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD
260-123286-0027-2119:	I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF THE (ICHTHYOSAURUS->ICTISSORIS) GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT (COAL->CO) AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
260-123286-0028-2120:	ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH
260-123286-0029-2121:	THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACKED EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
260-123286-0030-2122:	SUDDENLY THE (ICHTHYOSAURUS->ICY SOURIS) AND THE (PLESIOSAURUS->PLECISSORIS) DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A (WHIRLPOOL->WAR POOL) EDDYING IN THE WATER
260-123286-0031-2123:	AS FOR THE (ICHTHYOSAURUS->ITHACAURUS) HAS HE RETURNED TO HIS SUBMARINE CAVERN
260-123288-0000-2124:	THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
260-123288-0001-2125:	THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE (THAT->THE) TERM (WILL->WE'LL) CHANGE BEFORE LONG
260-123288-0002-2126:	THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH (VAPOURS->VAPORS) PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF (SALINE->SALE) WATERS
260-123288-0003-2127:	THE ELECTRIC LIGHT CAN SCARCELY PENETRATE THROUGH THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH (HAS->IS) DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED
260-123288-0004-2128:	THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM
260-123288-0005-2129:	FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MIST WITH YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DENSE FLOOR OF GREY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE (OPAQUE->OPAKE) AND IMPENETRABLE MASS
260-123288-0006-2130:	THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY
260-123288-0007-2131:	THE WIND NEVER (LULLS->LOLLS) BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
260-123288-0008-2132:	THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
260-123288-0009-2133:	THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING TO CRUSH THE SEA
260-123288-0010-2134:	ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF A (LAMBENT->LAMENT) SAINT (ELMO'S->NOBLE'S) FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD
260-123288-0011-2135:	BUT IF WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE YET LEAVE THAT (SAIL->SALE) LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF (THE->A) TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT
260-123288-0012-2136:	THAT WILL BE (*->THE) SAFEST NO NO NEVER
260-123288-0013-2137:	THE PILED UP (VAPOURS CONDENSE->VAPORS CONDENSED) INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE (VACUUM->VALUE) LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE (MISTS->MIST) ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0014-2138:	HANS STIRS (NOT->NODDED)
260-123288-0015-2139:	FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
260-123288-0016-2140:	I REFER TO THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED
260-123288-0017-2141:	IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED (THIS->ITS) DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL
260-123288-0018-2142:	THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST
260-123288-0019-2143:	AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES
260-123288-0020-2144:	EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT
260-123288-0021-2145:	THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
260-123288-0022-2146:	THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE
260-123288-0023-2147:	HE NODS HIS CONSENT
260-123288-0024-2148:	THE (FIREBALL->FIRE BALL) HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
260-123288-0025-2149:	HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE
260-123288-0026-2150:	WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING (DISK->DISC) OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT
260-123288-0027-2151:	A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS
260-123288-0028-2152:	WE SUFFER STIFLING PAINS
260-123440-0000-2153:	AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK
260-123440-0001-2154:	POOR ALICE
260-123440-0002-2155:	IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WITH A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME OH THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS
260-123440-0003-2156:	OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
260-123440-0004-2157:	ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TO DAY
260-123440-0005-2158:	AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0006-2159:	I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
260-123440-0007-2160:	I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
260-123440-0008-2161:	I'LL TRY IF I KNOW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW
260-123440-0009-2162:	I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0010-2163:	HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GRIN HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS
260-123440-0011-2164:	NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M MABEL I'LL STAY DOWN HERE
260-123440-0012-2165:	IT'LL BE NO USE (THEIR->THEY'RE) PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SAYING COME UP AGAIN DEAR
260-123440-0013-2166:	I AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE
260-123440-0014-2167:	AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS
260-123440-0015-2168:	I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
260-123440-0016-2169:	I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS
260-123440-0017-2170:	THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING (*->FOR) TO BE SURE
260-123440-0018-2171:	I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE (O->OH) MOUSE
260-123440-0019-2172:	CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED
260-123440-0020-2173:	WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED
2830-3979-0000-2311:	WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT
2830-3979-0001-2312:	THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN (STREAMLINE HIM->STREAM LINHAM) SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK (TODAY->TO DAY) TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0002-2313:	LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY (ON GALATIANS->ANGULATIONS)
2830-3979-0003-2314:	THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
2830-3979-0004-2315:	IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
2830-3979-0005-2316:	THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
2830-3979-0006-2317:	A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY (ON GALATIANS->ANGULATIONS)
2830-3979-0007-2318:	MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN (EDITION->ADDITION) OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE (MY GALATIANS->MIGRATIONS) FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0008-2319:	IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND (ROERER->ROAR) PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009-2320:	IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0010-2321:	BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE
2830-3979-0011-2322:	THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO (LUKE->LOOK) TWO
2830-3979-0012-2323:	THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND (FOREVER->FOR EVER)
2830-3980-0000-2234:	IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL
2830-3980-0001-2235:	THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL
2830-3980-0002-2236:	HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
2830-3980-0003-2237:	PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US
2830-3980-0004-2238:	INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
2830-3980-0005-2239:	DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
2830-3980-0006-2240:	AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY (AND->IN) MINISTRY
2830-3980-0007-2241:	AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN
2830-3980-0008-2242:	PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
2830-3980-0009-2243:	PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA
2830-3980-0010-2244:	EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES
2830-3980-0011-2245:	PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
2830-3980-0012-2246:	THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
2830-3980-0013-2247:	HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD
2830-3980-0014-2248:	THE CALL (IS->WAS) NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
2830-3980-0015-2249:	FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
2830-3980-0016-2250:	IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK
2830-3980-0017-2251:	WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
2830-3980-0018-2252:	I DID NOT THEN (REALIZE->REALISE) THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY
2830-3980-0019-2253:	I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SOPHISTRY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING
2830-3980-0020-2254:	THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS HOLY PRIDE
2830-3980-0021-2255:	AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
2830-3980-0022-2256:	THE CLAUSE (SEEMS->SEEMED) SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT
2830-3980-0023-2257:	THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH
2830-3980-0024-2258:	IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0025-2259:	BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
2830-3980-0026-2260:	VERSE TWO
2830-3980-0027-2261:	AND ALL THE BRETHREN WHICH ARE WITH ME
2830-3980-0028-2262:	THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES
2830-3980-0029-2263:	ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
2830-3980-0030-2264:	THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE
2830-3980-0031-2265:	WHY DO THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
2830-3980-0032-2266:	WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH (EYE->I) HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
2830-3980-0033-2267:	NOT ALL THE (GALATIANS->GLACIERS) HAD BECOME PERVERTED
2830-3980-0034-2268:	THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED
2830-3980-0035-2269:	THEY (REMAIN->REMAINED) DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION
2830-3980-0036-2270:	WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTICHRIST REIGNS THERE
2830-3980-0037-2271:	SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE
2830-3980-0038-2272:	GRACE BE TO YOU (AND->IN) PEACE FROM GOD (THE->TO) FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0039-2273:	THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD
2830-3980-0040-2274:	THE GREETING OF THE APOSTLE IS REFRESHING
2830-3980-0041-2275:	GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE
2830-3980-0042-2276:	THE WORLD BRANDS THIS A PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE
2830-3980-0043-2277:	EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS
2830-3980-0044-2278:	HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
2830-3980-0045-2279:	MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0046-2280:	WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO (SAY->SAVE) FROM GOD THE FATHER
2830-3980-0047-2281:	TO DO SO IS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND TO COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY
2830-3980-0048-2282:	HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
2830-3980-0049-2283:	EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
2830-3980-0050-2284:	DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME
2830-3980-0051-2285:	WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
2830-3980-0052-2286:	WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
2830-3980-0053-2287:	AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
2830-3980-0054-2288:	THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
2830-3980-0055-2289:	TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT
2830-3980-0056-2290:	OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
2830-3980-0057-2291:	THE (ARIANS->AREAS) TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
2830-3980-0058-2292:	MOHAMMED ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST
2830-3980-0059-2293:	PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME
2830-3980-0060-2294:	HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE
2830-3980-0061-2295:	NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR (PASCHAL->PASHALL) LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
2830-3980-0062-2296:	NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BUT FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0063-2297:	UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES
2830-3980-0064-2298:	HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS
2830-3980-0065-2299:	PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHO IS NAMED JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0066-2300:	SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY (CANNOT->COULD NOT) BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS
2830-3980-0067-2301:	THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
2830-3980-0068-2302:	THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS
2830-3980-0069-2303:	THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SIN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0070-2304:	BUT WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
2830-3980-0071-2305:	WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MERIT WE CAN DISMISS (SIN->IN)
2830-3980-0072-2306:	THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN
2830-3980-0073-2307:	THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
2830-3980-0074-2308:	THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
2830-3980-0075-2309:	BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM
2830-3980-0076-2310:	ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR
2961-960-0000-1770:	HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO (MAN->MEN) FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT (AND->AN) OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
2961-960-0001-1771:	THE INFLUENCE (WITH->WHICH) THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING
2961-960-0002-1772:	IN THE SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE (NEO PLATONISTS->NEOPLATONISTS) FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS (AND->IN) CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
2961-960-0003-1773:	THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CHARACTERISTIC IN HIM HIS EFFORT TO (REALIZE->REALISE) AND CONNECT (ABSTRACTIONS->OBSTRUCTIONS) WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL
2961-960-0004-1774:	THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON THE TIMAEUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE (NEO PLATONISTS->NEOPLATONISTS)
2961-960-0005-1775:	IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT
2961-960-0006-1776:	THE FANCIES OF THE (NEO PLATONISTS->NEOPLATONISTS) ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY
2961-960-0007-1777:	BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM
2961-960-0008-1778:	WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN (DIALOGUES->DIALECTS) OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE (TWO TRILOGIES->TUTRILOGIES) WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
2961-960-0009-1779:	THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS
2961-960-0010-1780:	BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET DEFINED THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN RANKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL
2961-960-0011-1781:	WITH (HERACLEITUS->HERACLITUS) HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE (ANAXAGORAS->AN ECAGARIS) HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
2961-960-0012-1782:	MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE (PRE SOCRATIC->PRESUCRATIC) PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS
2961-960-0013-1783:	IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE
2961-960-0014-1784:	THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
2961-960-0015-1785:	THE STYLE AND PLAN OF THE TIMAEUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES
2961-960-0016-1786:	BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME (MASTERY->MYSTERY) OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE (PHAEDRUS->FIDRES) OR SYMPOSIUM
2961-960-0017-1787:	NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY OR ART OF (THE->*) INTRODUCTION IN WHICH (HE IS->HIS) USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER
2961-960-0018-1788:	BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP
2961-960-0019-1789:	HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER AND THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
2961-960-0020-1790:	AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS
2961-960-0021-1791:	THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
2961-960-0022-1792:	PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
2961-961-0000-1747:	(SOCRATES->SOVERESE) BEGINS THE (TIMAEUS->TIMIRES) WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
2961-961-0001-1748:	AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
2961-961-0002-1749:	AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
2961-961-0003-1750:	I WILL IF (TIMAEUS APPROVES->DEMI) I APPROVE
2961-961-0004-1751:	LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF (SOLON'S->SOLONS) WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF (DROPIDAS->TROPIDUS) MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME
2961-961-0005-1752:	SOME POEMS OF (SOLON->SOLOMON) WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS
2961-961-0006-1753:	AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK
2961-961-0007-1754:	THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED
2961-961-0008-1755:	BUT THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS (HAS->HAD) PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS
2961-961-0009-1756:	TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE (SOLON->SOLOMON) HEARD (THE->THIS) STORY
2961-961-0010-1757:	BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOR EVER IN OUR TEMPLES
2961-961-0011-1758:	THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN (ANNALS SOLON->ANNAL SOLEM) ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
2961-961-0012-1759:	FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DID THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN
2961-961-0013-1760:	(SOLON->SULLEN) MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS
2961-961-0014-1761:	NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE SHE (FOUNDED->FOUND IT) YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE (FOUNDED->FOUND IT) OURS AS OUR (ANNALS->END'S) RECORD
2961-961-0015-1762:	MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME
2961-961-0016-1763:	I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SACRED REGISTERS
2961-961-0017-1764:	OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CARE THE LAW TOOK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF (MAN->MEN)
2961-961-0018-1765:	THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS
2961-961-0019-1766:	FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTHER (HELLENES->HELLIANS) HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS
2961-961-0020-1767:	THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
2961-961-0021-1768:	BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY
2961-961-0022-1769:	THEN NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF (MAN->MEN) AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MEN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF WHOM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LOST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN (RECORD->RECORDS) SPOKE
3570-5694-0000-1324:	BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR (ANTEDATING->ANTED) THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY (SPECIALISED->SPECIALIZED) CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM
3570-5694-0001-1325:	THE UTILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A (DERIVATIVE->DERIVITY OF) GROWTH
3570-5694-0002-1326:	SUCH CONSUMPTION AS FALLS TO THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED (LABOUR->LABOR) AND NOT A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND (FULNESS->FULLNESS) OF LIFE
3570-5694-0003-1327:	WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS (TABU->TABOO) MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A (TABU->TABOO) OR A LARGER CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DO NOT CHANGE EASILY
3570-5694-0004-1328:	IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONG TO THE LEISURE CLASS
3570-5694-0005-1329:	UNDER THE (TABU->TABOO) CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS
3570-5694-0006-1330:	DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
3570-5694-0007-1331:	IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO (EVERYDAY->EVERY DAY) SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE
3570-5694-0008-1332:	THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE IS A CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER
3570-5694-0009-1333:	WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT (AND BINDING->UNBINDING) THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS
3570-5694-0010-1334:	THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OBVIOUS THAN SUBSTANTIAL
3570-5694-0011-1335:	THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES
3570-5694-0012-1336:	THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK AND (GRADES->GRATES)
3570-5694-0013-1337:	THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
3570-5694-0014-1338:	MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME LESSER MEN OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ARE SCARCELY AT ALL OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMERS
3570-5694-0015-1339:	SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND (HANGERS ON->HANGERSON) OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
3570-5694-0016-1340:	MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA
3570-5694-0017-1341:	THE WEARING OF UNIFORMS OR LIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE
3570-5694-0018-1342:	THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIVERIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SERVILE OR THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE
3570-5694-0019-1343:	BUT THE GENERAL DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED
3570-5694-0020-1344:	SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
3570-5694-0021-1345:	WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH THE PRIMARY LEISURE EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED HONORIFIC CHARACTER
3570-5694-0022-1346:	THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
3570-5695-0000-1347:	IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
3570-5695-0001-1348:	THE DEPENDENT WHO WAS FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OR THE CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE (CUSTOMARILY->ACCUSTOMARILY) PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST
3570-5695-0002-1349:	BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF (VICARIOUS->VICARUS) LEISURE AND CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE
3570-5695-0003-1350:	IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN CULTURE THIS POINT IS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS
3570-5695-0004-1351:	IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT
3570-5695-0005-1352:	THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE (SLUMS->SLEMS) THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASE TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLD'S PECUNIARY DECENCY
3570-5695-0006-1353:	VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST (PRETENSE->PRETENCE) OF PECUNIARY DECENCY IS PUT AWAY
3570-5695-0007-1354:	THERE IS NO CLASS (AND->IN) NO COUNTRY THAT HAS YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED
3570-5695-0008-1355:	THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO (AFFECT->EFFECT)
3570-5695-0009-1356:	EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH
3570-5695-0010-1357:	THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
3570-5695-0011-1358:	IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE
3570-5695-0012-1359:	IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SERVICEABILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WHERE THE HUMAN CONTACT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST
3570-5695-0013-1360:	CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGER ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY
3570-5695-0014-1361:	AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS (PLACE IS->PLACES) TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE
3570-5695-0015-1362:	THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
3570-5696-0000-1363:	UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET
3570-5696-0001-1364:	BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE (QUASI->CORSY) PEACEABLE CULTURE
3570-5696-0002-1365:	(OTHER->ARE THE) CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH (FAVOR->FAVOUR) UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE
3570-5696-0003-1366:	A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MANY (AND->AN) INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC
3570-5696-0004-1367:	THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED
3570-5696-0005-1368:	THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES
3570-5696-0006-1369:	AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF (EVERYDAY->EVERY DAY) LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION
3570-5696-0007-1370:	THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE
3570-5696-0008-1371:	BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM (WASTE->WASTES) IN THE LANGUAGE OF (EVERYDAY->EVERY DAY) LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
3570-5696-0009-1372:	IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE BUT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON
3570-5696-0010-1373:	AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL AND WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS
3575-170457-0000-168:	AND OFTEN (HAS->AS) MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
3575-170457-0001-169:	WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY
3575-170457-0002-170:	WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED
3575-170457-0003-171:	SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE ARE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR (IN->AND) IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE
3575-170457-0004-172:	WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION
3575-170457-0005-173:	SHE (A TORY AND->ARIAN) CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT (DISSENT->DESCENT) AND RADICALISM
3575-170457-0006-174:	HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE (ANY ONE->ANYONE) WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE
3575-170457-0007-175:	HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE
3575-170457-0008-176:	AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLENT RADICALS AND DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND (HONOURED->HONORED)
3575-170457-0009-177:	JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM (SOUTHEY->SALLY)
3575-170457-0010-178:	I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE
3575-170457-0011-179:	BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
3575-170457-0012-180:	YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
3575-170457-0013-181:	THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LESS LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION
3575-170457-0014-182:	TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY
3575-170457-0015-183:	BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
3575-170457-0016-184:	FAREWELL (MADAM->MADAME)
3575-170457-0017-185:	THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT (SOUTHEY->SELIN)
3575-170457-0018-186:	SIR MARCH SIXTEENTH
3575-170457-0019-187:	I (HAD->HAVE) NOT VENTURED TO HOPE FOR SUCH A REPLY SO CONSIDERATE IN ITS TONE SO NOBLE IN ITS SPIRIT
3575-170457-0020-188:	I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU (WAS->IS) ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER THE IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE
3575-170457-0021-189:	I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
3575-170457-0022-190:	IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANY ONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS
3575-170457-0023-191:	I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST TO SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS
3575-170457-0024-192:	I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING (OR->A) WRITING BUT I TRY TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PRIVATION
3575-170457-0025-193:	AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A BRIGHT DREAM
3575-170457-0026-194:	P S (*->P) PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I COULD NOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SORROWFULLY AND RELUCTANTLY IT MAY BE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C B
3575-170457-0027-195:	I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING (SOUTHEY'S->SO THESE) REPLY
3575-170457-0028-196:	(KESWICK->KEZWICK) MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR (MADAM->MADAME)
3575-170457-0029-197:	YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO
3575-170457-0030-198:	OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES
3575-170457-0031-199:	ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE WRITES
3575-170457-0032-200:	COME COME (I AM->I'M) GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE
3575-170457-0033-201:	SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES (ROUND->AROUND) AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT (MISS E->MISSY) IS COME OH DEAR
3575-170457-0034-202:	IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
3575-170457-0035-203:	I WISH IT WOULD RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE (ESTRANGEMENT->ENSRANGEMENT) OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY
3575-170457-0036-204:	MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED IN SHORT BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH
3575-170457-0037-205:	IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART IS A VERY (HOTBED->HOT BED) FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR (*->A) DIRECTION
3575-170457-0038-206:	AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY IS RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG
3575-170457-0039-207:	THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY (SHRIVELLED->SHRIVELED) UP MORE OR LESS
3575-170457-0040-208:	INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
3575-170457-0041-209:	SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISCHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY
3575-170457-0042-210:	UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE (COULD NOT->CANNOT) BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
3575-170457-0043-211:	HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO A HIGHER DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU WERE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT (IT->AND) MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST
3575-170457-0044-212:	AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
3575-170457-0045-213:	I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
3575-170457-0046-214:	A GOOD (NEIGHBOUR->NEIGHBOR) OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A (DRUGGIST'S->DRUGGIST) SHOP IN HAWORTH (AND->*) FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND IN MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE (HOUSEHOLDS->HOUSEHOLD'S) ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH (TABBY'S->TABBEY'S) FRACTURED LEG
3575-170457-0047-215:	TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY
3575-170457-0048-216:	HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE
3575-170457-0049-217:	THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
3575-170457-0050-218:	(TABBY->TABBE) HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
3575-170457-0051-219:	AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE
3575-170457-0052-220:	SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS
3575-170457-0053-221:	BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCHED OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG
3575-170457-0054-222:	STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
3575-170457-0055-223:	STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAYS SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH THE LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR
3575-170457-0056-224:	I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME
3729-6852-0000-330:	TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON (SILVIA->SYLVIA) GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
3729-6852-0001-331:	WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT

4507-16021-0010-2184:	WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST A SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED (AND->IN) FULFILLED MERITS
4507-16021-0011-2185:	WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING
4507-16021-0012-2186:	WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
4507-16021-0013-2187:	NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG

4507-16021-0030-2204:	ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
4507-16021-0031-2205:	AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED

4970-29093-0004-1171:	HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4970-29093-0005-1172:	SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A (CONSPICUOUS->CONSPICIOUS) PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACH THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALE'S VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE (BUL BUL->BULL) SINGS ON THE (OFF NIGHTS->OPNITES)
4970-29093-0006-1173:	LAW SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOPPED WITH THIS NEW CLERK IN THE (ANTE ROOM->ANTEROOM) OF THE LAW OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE (ATTENDANT FEES->ATTENDANTPIES)

4970-29093-0012-1179:	BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
4970-29093-0013-1180:	AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND TO HIS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD
4970-29093-0014-1181:	WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER YOU (CAN->COULD) GO AS ONE

4970-29095-0019-1147:	AND THEN THERE WAS BROAD STREET
4970-29095-0020-1148:	THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL POINT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST

5683-32866-0000-874:	MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
5683-32866-0001-875:	AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY
5683-32866-0002-876:	BUT DON'T THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY

5683-32866-0019-893:	THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STEADY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVE THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTHED MALIGNITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND (A->THE) SPECIAL SATANIC ACTION
5683-32866-0020-894:	THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
5683-32866-0021-895:	MY BED WAS (UNEXCEPTIONABLY->UNEXCEPTIONALLY) COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN

6930-75918-0012-2554:	IT IS ANNOYANCE THEN
6930-75918-0013-2555:	IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN ADDED MORE
6930-75918-0014-2556:	BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
6930-75918-0015-2557:	THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR (COUNTRY'S->COUNTRY) OUR (MASTER'S->MASTERS) AND OUR OWN
6930-75918-0016-2558:	YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TO DAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
6930-75918-0017-2559:	BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAOUL COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT
6930-75918-0018-2560:	THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE
6930-75918-0019-2561:	UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
6930-75918-0020-2562:	(BRAGELONNE->BRAGELON) WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AND (UNCIVIL->UNCIVILLED) SLUMBERS OF MANICAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLET SUIT
6930-76324-0000-2563:	GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY
6930-76324-0001-2564:	THEY WERE CERTAINLY NO (NEARER->NEAR) THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM
6930-76324-0002-2565:	THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS
6930-76324-0003-2566:	NOW WHAT (WAS->IS) THE SENSE OF IT TWO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT
6930-76324-0004-2567:	BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION
6930-76324-0005-2568:	THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL
6930-76324-0006-2569:	HERS HAPPENED TO BE (IN->ON) THE SAME FRAME TOO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT (THAT->IT)
6930-76324-0007-2570:	NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA (SPRAGUE->SPROG)
6930-76324-0008-2571:	I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT PICTURE BUT IT'S BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL
6930-76324-0009-2572:	DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MINIATURE WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING
6930-76324-0010-2573:	WHAT IN THE WORLD IS (THAT->IT) QUERIED JOYCE
6930-76324-0011-2574:	(THEY->MAY) WORRY ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME (CYN->SIN)
6930-76324-0012-2575:	WE'LL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING
6930-76324-0013-2576:	IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
6930-76324-0014-2577:	THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR
6930-76324-0015-2578:	SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT
6930-76324-0016-2579:	THE LURE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER IT AS (FRISKILY->FRISKLY) AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
6930-76324-0017-2580:	OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
6930-76324-0018-2581:	HE MAKES IT SORT OF (COZIER->COSIER)
6930-76324-0019-2582:	NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
6930-76324-0020-2583:	YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM
6930-76324-0021-2584:	SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
6930-76324-0022-2585:	THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED
6930-76324-0023-2586:	AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
6930-76324-0024-2587:	THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY (CANDLE LIGHT->CANDLELIGHT) IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD
6930-76324-0025-2588:	WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN
6930-76324-0026-2589:	ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS
6930-76324-0027-2590:	FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING (AN->ON) OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER
6930-76324-0028-2591:	WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
6930-81414-0000-2592:	NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY
6930-81414-0001-2593:	I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW (KAFFAR->CAFFRE) HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME
6930-81414-0002-2594:	ONWARD SAID A DISTANT VOICE
6930-81414-0003-2595:	NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT
6930-81414-0004-2596:	THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
6930-81414-0005-2597:	WHAT WAS THAT
6930-81414-0006-2598:	WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND
6930-81414-0007-2599:	NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
6930-81414-0008-2600:	IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
6930-81414-0009-2601:	I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS (KAFFAR->CAFFRE)
6930-81414-0010-2602:	A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT
6930-81414-0011-2603:	A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
6930-81414-0012-2604:	SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNIZED AS VOLTAIRE'S (KAFFAR->KAFFIR)
6930-81414-0013-2605:	I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
6930-81414-0014-2606:	IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO (DISCOLOURED->DISCOLORED)
6930-81414-0015-2607:	I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED
6930-81414-0016-2608:	BUT THAT IS (KAFFAR'S->KAFFIR'S) KNIFE
6930-81414-0017-2609:	I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
6930-81414-0018-2610:	I (REMEMBER->REMEMBERED) SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
6930-81414-0019-2611:	(VOLTAIRE->VULTURE) PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
6930-81414-0020-2612:	I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
6930-81414-0021-2613:	A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND
6930-81414-0022-2614:	I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER
6930-81414-0023-2615:	PERCHANCE TOO (KAFFAR'S->KAFFIR'S) DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD
6930-81414-0024-2616:	MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME
6930-81414-0025-2617:	MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE
6930-81414-0026-2618:	MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST
6930-81414-0027-2619:	FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
7021-79730-0000-641:	THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT
7021-79730-0001-642:	TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN (EFFECTING->AFFECTING) SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
7021-79730-0002-643:	BY REASON AND AFFECTION
7021-79730-0003-644:	AS THE (CHAISE->CHASE) DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE (DOOR STEP->DOORSTEP) HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL (HUMOR->HUMOUR) SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE (DELICATE->DELEGATE) ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DOING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY
7021-79730-0004-645:	THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHAISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF HER COUNTENANCE GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION (UPON->ON) HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE
7021-79730-0005-646:	SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU
7021-79730-0006-647:	THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION
7021-79730-0007-648:	IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
7021-79730-0008-649:	BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
7021-79730-0009-650:	IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION (CAN NOT->CANNOT) BE OVERRATED
7021-79740-0000-598:	TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
7021-79740-0001-599:	DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE
7021-79740-0002-600:	NOW DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
7021-79740-0003-601:	TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
7021-79740-0004-602:	YOU HAVE COME (ANDELLA ANDELLA->AND DELLA AND DELLA) WAS THE NAME OF (JANE'S DOLL->JANE STAL) TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
7021-79740-0005-603:	I AM VERY GLAD
7021-79740-0006-604:	I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL (ANDELLA->AND DELLA) SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
7021-79740-0007-605:	THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE
7021-79740-0008-606:	FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
7021-79740-0009-607:	THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR
7021-79740-0010-608:	DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE (ANDELLA->ANDDELLA) AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM
7021-79740-0011-609:	SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE
7021-79740-0012-610:	SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE
7021-79740-0013-611:	PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW (ANY THING->ANYTHING) ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT
7021-79740-0014-612:	AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
7021-79759-0000-592:	NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS
7021-79759-0001-593:	THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING
7021-79759-0002-594:	THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD
7021-79759-0003-595:	VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING
7021-79759-0004-596:	WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD (IMPRESSES->IMPRESS) UPON THE MIND
7021-79759-0005-597:	THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
7021-85628-0000-613:	BUT (ANDERS->ANDREWS) CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT
7021-85628-0001-614:	HE MADE A (BOW->BOUGH) SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT (ANDERS->ANDRES)
7021-85628-0002-615:	HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0003-616:	NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACK KNIFE
7021-85628-0004-617:	YES WHY NOT THOUGHT (ANDERS->ANDREWS)
7021-85628-0005-618:	SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
7021-85628-0006-619:	I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED (ANDERS->ANDREWS)
7021-85628-0007-620:	AND SHE TOOK (ANDERS->ANDREW'S) HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
7021-85628-0008-621:	FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
7021-85628-0009-622:	AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS
7021-85628-0010-623:	ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED (WINE->WINES) SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS
7021-85628-0011-624:	THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHE LET (ANDERS->ANDREW) SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
7021-85628-0012-625:	BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
7021-85628-0013-626:	THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
7021-85628-0014-627:	HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
7021-85628-0015-628:	WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
7021-85628-0016-629:	THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
7021-85628-0017-630:	SO IT IS SAID (ANDERS->ANDREWS)
7021-85628-0018-631:	AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
7021-85628-0019-632:	WITH ONE JUMP ANDERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
7021-85628-0020-633:	HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
7021-85628-0021-634:	HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE
7021-85628-0022-635:	AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
7021-85628-0023-636:	BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT (ANDERS->ANDREWS) WAS A STUPID
7021-85628-0024-637:	(ANDERS->ANDRE'S) FACE GREW RED
7021-85628-0025-638:	BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE
7021-85628-0026-639:	NO MY LITTLE (SON->FUN) SHE SAID
7021-85628-0027-640:	IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
7127-75946-0000-1549:	AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS WERE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT
7127-75946-0001-1550:	AH VERY WELL
7127-75946-0002-1551:	LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF (AU COURANT->AUQUAND) WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
7127-75946-0003-1552:	GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT (AIGNAN->ANJON) AND (VILLEROY->VILLEROI) TOOK THEIR LEAVE
7127-75946-0004-1553:	CERTAINLY SIRE BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
7127-75946-0005-1554:	WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED (LOUIS->LOUISE)
7127-75946-0006-1555:	HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
7127-75946-0007-1556:	IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY THE KING FROWNED
7127-75946-0008-1557:	DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DISLOYAL ATTEMPT
7127-75946-0009-1558:	NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME
7127-75946-0010-1559:	YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS
7127-75946-0011-1560:	YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0012-1561:	THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION
7127-75946-0013-1562:	THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS (TOILETTE->TOILET) BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS
7127-75946-0014-1563:	THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT (DIAS->DAIS) OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A (THEATER->THEATRE) OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION
7127-75946-0015-1564:	SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE
7127-75946-0016-1565:	THE SEASONS ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE
7127-75946-0017-1566:	HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLORED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF
7127-75946-0018-1567:	THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS (SEEM->SEEMED) TO SOAR ALONG
7127-75946-0019-1568:	YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75946-0020-1569:	FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED IT
7127-75946-0021-1570:	YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET
7127-75946-0022-1571:	SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE
7127-75946-0023-1572:	THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
7127-75946-0024-1573:	MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
7127-75946-0025-1574:	THE (BALLET->VALET) BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
7127-75946-0026-1575:	WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE (THEATER->THEATRE) SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75946-0027-1576:	DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO (ACKNOWLEDGEMENT->ACKNOWLEDGMENT) HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKED PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0028-1577:	BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0029-1578:	THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75947-0000-1508:	EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE (BEDIMMED->BEDEMNED)

7127-75947-0009-1517:	A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE (THEATER->THEATRE) BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART

7127-75947-0039-1547:	IN FACT THE SOUND OF (MADAME'S->MADAMS) AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE (MOUNTED->MOUNTAIN) CAVALIERS
7127-75947-0040-1548:	IN THIS WAY THE FETE OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FETE ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER (IN->AND) THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX (IN->AND) ITS HOLE WERE ALL LISTENING
7176-88083-0000-1898:	ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT AND BROKEN COLOR SCATTERED IN BROAD SPLASHES
7176-88083-0001-1899:	THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND A BREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK
7176-88083-0002-1900:	HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED
7176-88083-0003-1901:	BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS
7176-88083-0004-1902:	BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0005-1903:	ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH
7176-88083-0006-1904:	IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL
7176-88083-0007-1905:	BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS (ENGORGED->INGORGED) VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT AT THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY
7176-88083-0008-1906:	IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON
7176-88083-0009-1907:	THE GREAT HAWK (FOLLOWED->FOWLED) HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND
7176-88083-0010-1908:	THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JAWS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT
7176-88083-0011-1909:	IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED IT THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED
7176-88083-0012-1910:	THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED
7176-88083-0013-1911:	LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN THE TEAL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM
7176-88083-0014-1912:	THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE
7176-88083-0015-1913:	ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP
7176-88083-0016-1914:	STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM
7176-88083-0017-1915:	BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN
7176-88083-0018-1916:	BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
7176-88083-0019-1917:	AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD
7176-88083-0020-1918:	WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH
7176-88083-0021-1919:	BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES OF THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM WHILE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE
7176-88083-0022-1920:	THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGGED IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED
7176-88083-0023-1921:	HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING
7176-88083-0024-1922:	THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST IN THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY
7176-88083-0025-1923:	AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK
7176-88083-0026-1924:	THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING
7176-88083-0027-1925:	THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE
7176-92135-0000-1852:	HE IS A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM EDITORS ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO (A SYMPOSIUM->HIS IMPOSIUM) ON THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS
7176-92135-0001-1853:	IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO
7176-92135-0002-1854:	BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS
7176-92135-0003-1855:	YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
7176-92135-0004-1856:	FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY
7176-92135-0005-1857:	BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH
7176-92135-0006-1858:	I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE PLOT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
7176-92135-0007-1859:	ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND I CAN DO THE DIALOGUE ALL RIGHT
7176-92135-0008-1860:	LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGECRAFT IS
7176-92135-0009-1861:	AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY
7176-92135-0010-1862:	(HAM->HIM) TO BE OR NOT TO BE
7176-92135-0011-1863:	NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN
7176-92135-0012-1864:	INDEED IRRESOLUTION BEING THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JAW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE (DRAMATIST'S->DRAMATISTS) MEANING
7176-92135-0013-1865:	WE MODERNS HOWEVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT
7176-92135-0014-1866:	IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO (*->THE) MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALL A SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY
7176-92135-0015-1867:	AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT
7176-92135-0016-1868:	THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
7176-92135-0017-1869:	IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAY IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
7176-92135-0018-1870:	IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS (HIM->THEM) WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL

7729-102255-0003-934:	FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER (RUFFIAN->IN) RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE

7729-102255-0040-971:	IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND THE DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE (EMIGRANT->IMMIGRANT) AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST (HONORABLE->HONOURABLE) AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION
7729-102255-0041-972:	THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
7729-102255-0042-973:	RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSOURI

7729-102255-0044-975:	HERE HE WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD (LEAVENWORTH->LEVIN WORTH) UNDER (A->THE) REIGN OF TERROR
7729-102255-0045-976:	CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO HELP PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST
7729-102255-0046-977:	IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINTH A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE (PRO SLAVERY->PROSLAVERY) MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIES TO (LECOMPTON->LACOMPTON) IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY
8224-274381-0000-992:	THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0001-993:	AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF (MERCHISTON->MURCHISTON) SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED
8224-274381-0002-994:	WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH (COVENANTERS->COVINANTERS) WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
8224-274381-0003-995:	THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO (MONTROSE'S->MONTROZI'S) COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND
8224-274381-0004-996:	FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD (ELCHO->ELKO) WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
8224-274381-0005-997:	DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED (NORTHWARDS->NORTHWARD) IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF (HUNTLEY->HUNTLY) AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0006-998:	THIS NOBLEMAN'S CHARACTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM
8224-274381-0007-999:	BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0008-1000:	WITH THESE AND SOME (REENFORCEMENTS->REINFORCEMENTS) OF THE (ATHOLEMEN->ATHOL MEN) AND MACDONALDS WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
8224-274381-0009-1001:	THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT (INNERLOCHY->INER LOCKI) SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM
8224-274381-0010-1002:	BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO (INNERLOCHY->INTERLOCKY) AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
8224-274381-0011-1003:	HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS
8224-274381-0012-1004:	MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS
8224-274381-0013-1005:	FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON
8224-274381-0014-1006:	BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION
8224-274381-0015-1007:	THOUGH THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS
8224-274381-0016-1008:	(VALOR->VALOUR) INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING
8224-274381-0017-1009:	HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED (ANY THING->ANYTHING) BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY (DETERMINED->DETERMINE) THE SUCCESS
8224-274384-0000-978:	HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT (ALBANS->ALBAN'S) AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL
8224-274384-0001-979:	THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
8224-274384-0002-980:	THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING
8224-274384-0003-981:	OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT
8224-274384-0004-982:	AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING
8224-274384-0005-983:	ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
8224-274384-0006-984:	THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS
8224-274384-0007-985:	HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
8224-274384-0008-986:	THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR
8224-274384-0009-987:	THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING
8224-274384-0010-988:	BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
8224-274384-0011-989:	THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY (WEAKENED->WEAKEN) THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
8224-274384-0012-990:	IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY
8224-274384-0013-991:	HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
8230-279154-0000-1084:	THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE
8230-279154-0001-1085:	WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL (CORRELATES->CORELITS) ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
8230-279154-0002-1086:	WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS (EVERYONE->EVERY ONE) WOULD AGREE THAT (IS->IT) HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
8230-279154-0003-1087:	AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
8230-279154-0004-1088:	THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
8230-279154-0005-1089:	ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL (TENABILITY->TUNABILITY) AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER
8230-279154-0006-1090:	THE (BEHAVIOURIST->BEHAVIORIST) WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF (BEHAVIOUR->BEHAVIOR) HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
8230-279154-0007-1091:	HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE (BEHAVIOURIST->BEHAVIORIST) FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
8230-279154-0008-1092:	BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED
8230-279154-0009-1093:	OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST IN FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE
8230-279154-0010-1094:	WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
8230-279154-0011-1095:	SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
8230-279154-0012-1096:	FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
8230-279154-0013-1097:	IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
8230-279154-0014-1098:	I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0015-1099:	THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0016-1100:	IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FEELING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS IN SOME REMEMBERED EVENT
8230-279154-0017-1101:	THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC (FEELING->FILLING) WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE (FEELING->FILLING) OF (PASTNESS->PASTORS) ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
8230-279154-0018-1102:	THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF A REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0019-1103:	IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS
8230-279154-0020-1104:	IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
8230-279154-0021-1105:	REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
8230-279154-0022-1106:	SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
8230-279154-0023-1107:	IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE
8230-279154-0024-1108:	THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
8230-279154-0025-1109:	WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
8230-279154-0026-1110:	THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
8230-279154-0027-1111:	A (GRAMOPHONE->GRAMMERPHONE) BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
8230-279154-0028-1112:	I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE (WHOLLY->HOLY) HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
8230-279154-0029-1113:	THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
8230-279154-0030-1114:	(SEMON'S->SIMON'S) TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
8230-279154-0031-1115:	THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY
8230-279154-0032-1116:	IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
8230-279154-0033-1117:	IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN (ILLUSION->ALLUSION) THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
8230-279154-0034-1118:	WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
8230-279154-0035-1119:	THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE
8230-279154-0036-1120:	A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
8230-279154-0037-1121:	RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
8230-279154-0038-1122:	WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
8230-279154-0039-1123:	THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
8230-279154-0040-1124:	THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
8230-279154-0041-1125:	THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
8230-279154-0042-1126:	THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
8230-279154-0043-1127:	OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
8455-210777-0000-2324:	I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
8455-210777-0001-2325:	HAD EVA (CRASWELLER->CRESSWELLER) NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER (BUNNIT->BUNNOT) AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND
8455-210777-0002-2326:	ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY
8455-210777-0003-2327:	AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF
8455-210777-0004-2328:	I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUARTER OF THE WORLD
8455-210777-0005-2329:	WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
8455-210777-0006-2330:	WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN (BATTLEAX->BATTLE AXE) SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0007-2331:	QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVA
8455-210777-0008-2332:	THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED ARE ON THE OTHER
8455-210777-0009-2333:	NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
8455-210777-0010-2334:	THEIR MASTERS SAID MISSUS NEVERBEND
8455-210777-0011-2335:	I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAX TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
8455-210777-0012-2336:	MISSUS (NEVERBEND->NEVERBEN) YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON
8455-210777-0013-2337:	JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES
8455-210777-0014-2338:	SIR KENNINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE
8455-210777-0015-2339:	I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO (CRASWELLERS->CRESTWELLERS) AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
8455-210777-0016-2340:	THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
8455-210777-0017-2341:	MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE (GENTLEMEN->GENTLEMAN) A VERY GOOD DINNER
8455-210777-0018-2342:	THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH HER
8455-210777-0019-2343:	THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES
8455-210777-0020-2344:	OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NOWHERE
8455-210777-0021-2345:	BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
8455-210777-0022-2346:	OF WHAT MISSUS (NEVERBEND->NEVERBEN) HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS
8455-210777-0023-2347:	WE SAT WITH THE (OFFICERS->OFFICER) SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE
8455-210777-0024-2348:	HOW MUCH OF EVIL (OF->A) REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAD THERE NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
8455-210777-0025-2349:	WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
8455-210777-0026-2350:	AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
8455-210777-0027-2351:	WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE (FARTHEST->FURTHEST) SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS
8455-210777-0028-2352:	JACK WOULD BECOME (EVA'S->YVA'S) HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRIED DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD
8455-210777-0029-2353:	THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
8455-210777-0030-2354:	MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
8455-210777-0031-2355:	YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER (*->AND) IN ENGLAND STANDS SO HIGH
8455-210777-0032-2356:	IT IS A DUTY SAID I
8455-210777-0033-2357:	BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT
